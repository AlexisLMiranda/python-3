# Ex. 1 Total Gym Visits
A gym has a weekly process that creates a CSV file for all the gym members.  The CSV file contains the member name and a
1 if they have visited the gym, else a 0:

```
Name, S, M, T, W, Th, F, S
Alice, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1
Bob, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Charlie, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0
```

Create a function called `find_total_visits()` that calculates the total number of visits from the data in the following files:
- [week-1.csv](week-1.csv)
- [week-2.csv](week-2.csv)
- [week-3.csv](week-3.csv)

The function will be consumed in the following manner:

```python
def ex1():
    total = find_total_visits()
    print(f"Total visits: {total}.")
```

Output:
```
Total visits: 21.
```
